## Frog and Leap Game
### 📌 Overview:
Developed a logic-based puzzle game in Python that focuses on algorithmic thinking, problem-solving, and state transitions through rule-based gameplay.

### 🛠 Tools & Technologies:
1. Python
2. Core Python (loops, conditionals, functions)

### 🚀 Key Highlights:
1. Implemented rule-based movement logic for valid frog moves
2. Modeled game states and transitions to reach the goal configuration
3. Applied iterative logic to track and update positions efficiently
4. Ensured correctness by validating each move against defined constraints

### 📈 Outcome:
Demonstrated strong logical reasoning and foundational programming skills by successfully solving a constraint-based puzzle using clean and efficient Python code.
